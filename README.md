# Temperature App

Temperature iPhone App of the iOS Study Group at San Francisco's Women Who Code Meetup Group.

## Current Branch

Week 2 Homework - https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ios-study-group/DfHbpCfQCoA

Requirements:

* Add a UILabel on your screen that displays the converted temperature.
* Add a UISegmentedControl so you can choose what conversion you want to do, then add a "Go" button to perform the calculation. (so remove the buttons we added!)
* Conform to the UITextFieldDelegate Protocol, so when you tap the return key your calculation is run.

### "Extra credit"
* _Didn't Do it Yet_ Require only numbers to be added to the text field (make sure you can type negative numbers!)
* _did it_ Change your keyboard to show numbers
* _Yay_ Make it pretty (add images, different colors, fonts, etc)


# Future Ideas
Doing this tutorial, I'm inspired by the creativity of the other people in my class! Let's share code! 
* Rotating backgrounds and themes
* Asian temperatures in Number (?)
